# C# (.NET)

Since you're here, you probably already read that C# is my favorite language. I've been using C# for a couple of years now.

Here are my favorite parts:
- Built-in async/await
- Json Serialization: going to and from json is a breeze
- SignalR: Websockets plus some other goodies, and it only takes around 20 lines of .NET code to get it running.
- Entity Framework: Postgres is my favorite DB, what's yours?
- ASP.NET Core: Yep, I realize, this one's a bit broad, but when you combine all the other great parts of .NET into a web framework, what's not to like about it?
- Reflection: Why access a field directly when you can manipulate it through its type? And how about those *magical* attributes? (No need to fret, it's just reflection).
- Pointers and pass-by-reference: you can be as dangerous as you'd like. Want to pretend you're in C for a day? No problem, just put it in an "unsafe" block!
- Interop with native unmanaged platforms: Python 🐍, you're not the only one who can call C libraries.

__⚡ Fun fact: the Azure App Service Front-End runs on ASP.NET Core, using Kestrel and YARP, see more details [here](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2022/08/16/A-Heavy-Lift.html).__

__⚡ Another fun fact: .NET is *CROSS PLATFORM*__.
