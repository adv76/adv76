# About me

Computer Science Major at Grand Valley State University

## Interesting coursework:

* __Structure of Programming Languages:__ Co-authored a clone of Atari Breakout as introduction to Python programming.
You can find the code repository on my GitHub [here](https://github.com/adv76/343breakout).
* __Web Programming:__ Co-authored a website for a smoothie store in raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project can be found [here](https://github.com/adv76/CIS238-Website-Project).
* __Web Development:__ Co-authored a mock-up online store application using VueJS 3, TypeScript, and Google Firebase. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/adv76/cis371project).
* __Artificial Intelligence:__ Co-authored a pair of Pacman Agents following the [Berkeley AI Pacman Capture the Flag Contest](http://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html). Our team won the most games of any of the 10 or so teams in our class (although I need to keep the source code private, so you'll have to take my word for it). I also helped conduct a (largely unsuccessful) experiment with using Artificial Neural Networks and Minesweeper. The source for this project is available [here](https://github.com/adv76/python-tkinter-minesweeper).
* __Capstone Project:__ Co-authored a proof-of-concept NFT marketplace/social media platform. The backend API was built on Azure Functions in JavaScript using Azure Cosmos Database as its datastore. The frontend UI was built in Flutter using the FlutterFlow low-code Flutter app builder.
* __Game Programming Concepts (In Progress):__ Built a game engine in C# (.NET 6) on SDL2 using P/Invoke .NET Bindings by [Ethan Lee](https://github.com/flibitijibibo/SDL2-CS). Currently building a partial clone (with updated graphics of course) of [Air-Sea Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air-Sea_Battle) on top of that engine. I may release the source code in the future.

## Interesting work projects:

_** I've kept it semi-vague for Intellectual Property reasons **_
* Developed Add-ins for CAD software and modified post processors to add addition features and functionality for stone CNC machining
* Interfaced with a Z-Laser Projector in Python to customize laser projection
* Working on integrating with Fanuc CNCs using the Fanuc FOCAS protocol in .NET

## Experience

### Programming Languages

* C#
* JavaScript & TypeScript
* HTML
* Java & Kotlin
* C
* Python

C# is definitely my strongest language. I also do pretty well with JS/TS and Python. C can be frustrating because of how low level it is, but I've used it in multiple classes and know it quite well. I've done a fair amount of Java programming, but after discovering C#, I realized how much better C# is. I've also done some Android programming in Kotlin.

### Frameworks and Tools

* EntityFramework (.NET)
* ASP.NET Core (.NET)
* Svelte (JS/TS)
* Vue (JS/TS)
* TailwindCSS
