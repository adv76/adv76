### ✋ Hi there, I'm Alec
 
My favorite coding language is C#. 

__⚡ Fun fact: C# is the greatest programming language__.

Okay, maybe it's not a fact, but C# is pretty great... Read more about why I like it [here](https://adv68.github.io/adv68/CSHARP).

__🔨 My Dev Environment__

- Dev machine: Thinkpad X1 Carbon, Windows 10
- Favorite IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio.

__🔧 Other Cool Toys:__

- If your looking for a great terminal on Windows 10, check out [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).
- How about the re-birth of Win95 and XP's [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)? My favorite tools are FancyZones and the Color Picker.
- My favorite JS front-end framework: [SvelteJS](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte). If you're looking to try something new (and fun), try out SvelteJS + SvelteKit + TailwindCSS + TypeScript. I've played around with that stack a bit and am a big fan.
